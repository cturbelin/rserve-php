Rserve-php
==========

php5 client for Rserve http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/ (a TCP/IP server for R statistical software)

Files Description 
-------------------

* Connection.php : main class Rserve_Connection, you only need to manipulate an instance of this class (evalString method for now)
* helpers.php : helpers function librairies 
* Parser.php : Parser class used to Parse Rserve binary packets to php structures (native array or REXP children)
* RNative.php : an array wrapper used to catch attributes (experimental, usefull ?)
* REXP/*.php : R expression classes

Maturity
-----------------------

The library provide several way to parse R structures ($parser parameter in evalString)

- native php array : you get only the results in nested php array (without R attributes). It's a good way to handle simple R results.
This feature is in beta and has unit tests

- wrapped native php array : you get the results in a simple object (RNative) with results as php array and you can access to R object attributes.

- Debug : full description of the Rserve protocol results

- REXP: All R structures are wrapped in an REXP_* class
This feature is in alpha: not very documented, tests in progress. Only low level R structures are handled (data.frame is a GenericVector, etc..)

Tests
-----

You can run tests using phpunit

* Create a file config.php in the "tests" directory (copy config.php.sample)
* define the constant RSERVE_HOST with the address of your Rserve server (custom port not supported yet)
* run tests
  . phpunit tests\ParserNativeTest.php

Usage
---------

The use of the library is simple

1. create an instance of Rserve_Connection

  $cnx = new Rserve_Connection('myserverhost');

2. Send R commands and get the results as Php array

  $result = $cnx->evalString('x ="Hello world !"; x');

This will produce a php array containing R results (using native array parser). Others parsers could be used by using $parser parameters (@see Rserve_Connection)
